Habit Forming App (CCG): Feeling hard to form a habit? Try this app to track your progress! 

This Habit-Forming app project aims at helping people develop habits through a CCG (collecting card game) game scheme.
This app addresses the problem that people normally fail to achieve their goals due to a lack of motivation and visualization of progress. 
Through combining playfulness and practicality together, this app encourages people to stick to their goals and finally achieve them. 
If users manage to achieve the goal they set, a card with the scenery of a country/city/town will be awarded. 
A progress tracker will tell how far theyâ€™ve got from gaining a card. 
The more goals users manage to achieve, the more places in the world they will be able to unlock virtually. 
The scope of this project will be developing a progress tracker prototype (Single Page Application), 
which helps users to develop their perseverance while enjoying the playfulness of the app, and finally form various habits. 
More advanced CCG features and extensions of that will be added if time allowed.
