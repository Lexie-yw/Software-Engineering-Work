# **User-acceptance Testing**  
   In order to test whether our products can meet the needs of users as designed, We undertook the user-acceptance testing. 
    Our main test subjects are friends around us, and the app patch we used for test is our front-end patch. In order to facilitate users to provide feedback, 
    We recommend our users to suggest from the following aspects:

</p>
   * Functional completeness 
      Our application designed to provides the following functions:
      - Recording functions. Including target's content, including title, description and other details
      - Tracking function. User can keep tracking their app-using process
      - Review function. User can review their achievement through app
      - Reward system. User can get corresponding reward by app.
      We hope users give their opinion whether we complete these function.
   * Ease to use 
      we hope that our app not only function well, but also easy to use, this means, we try to simplify the user interface as much 
      as possible while maintaining the completeness of the functions, so as to make it easier for users to interact. We hope users to suggest from following aspects:
      - Pages/Button easy to find
      - Whether the page layout is reasonable 
      - Any other inconvenience about interaction
   * APP UI aesthetics
      At this part, we hope that users can give feedback on the look of our UI, including the overall style, color tone, layout etc.
   * App design logic
      We also hope that users could give us some suggestion about our app design logic, like our motivation and our strategy, Are they attractive enough, 
      or whether our strategy solves the problem we aim at. 
   * Other suggestion(Strengh/weakness)
        


   And finally we get some feedback from our user, We use the following diagram to summarize the representative opinions of test users.

   According to user feedback, most test users believe that our existing design is sufficient to meet our original design intentions, and can complete a series of processes such as setting goals, tracking goals, reviewing, and rewarding, and these functional pages or buttons are easy to find; Some test users think that the simple design style of our APP is very neat, while other users think that our page design is a bit simple; Many test users suggested that our reward system is a little bit simple and not attractive enough; Most test users said they have had the same troubles about habit forming, they think our APP has certain practical value, but they also said that our current model is not enough.
   

## **Future improvement points

   From the feedback given by our users, we want to do some future improvement about our app:
   * Beautify the interface of the program
   * Add more types of bonus cards, not just city views, and add relevant descriptions to the cards 
   * Add card exchange system between users 
   * More user-friendly program interface
