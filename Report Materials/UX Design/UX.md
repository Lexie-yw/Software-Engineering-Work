## Design Process
## Ideation
The team started the project with brainstorming ideas for a novel web application that can solve a real world problem while making users enjoy using it. To create such a product, we first started our discussion through teams on what problems we might solve and what game mechanisms we can adopt to solve the problems. Below is a Jamboard (Figure 1) we created during designing thinking:

As you can see, items on the left side are potential problems that exist in our life and the right side shows game mechanisms we came up with. We concluded that habit forming is what we are interested in, because nearly everyone has the experience of writing down new yearâ€™s goals at the beginning of a year but failed to achieve them when it came to the end of the year. There are tons of habit-tracking applications or progress tracker applications aiming at solving this problem in the digital market, but the problem with these apps is that they lack elements to keep users engaged in using them, such as games and rewards.

To implement a fun to use habit-forming application, we decided to add a Card Collecting Game (CCG) mechanism to the application to keep users engaged and motivated. Users who manage to track their goals and eventually achieve the goals will be rewarded with cards. The more goals they achieve, the more cards they will obtain and more likely to get all cards of a particular theme. The first theme of cards we implemented is city views, which caters to our tagline: form your habits to build your little planet. A possible extension of the app would be turning the CCG game mechanism to a Trading and Collecting Game (TCG) game mechanism, allowing users to exchange cards they obtained.

## Early Prototyping
We named our habit-forming application Little Planet and set a tagline for it: form your habits to build your little planet.  
### User Persona Sketch
Based on the conclusion from the ideation stage, we identified that our potential users would be people who are interested in progress tracking and habit forming, and the broader stakeholders would be relevant developers and product managers of the product. Below is a user persona sketch (Figure 2) we made to guide our initial prototyping:

</p>
No matter what age they are; where they are from; what occupation they have, as long as they are interested in personal development and want to achieve goals or form habits, they can use Little Planet to motivate themselves to make progress.


### Initial Prototyping
With the user persona sketch as a guidance, we decided that Little Planet should implement the following features:
  * Progress Tracking / Progress Visualization
  * CCG
  * Simple in Style
  * Streamlined Workflow

At the paper prototyping stage, considering the situation caused by the pandemic, we used teams and Figma these online collaboration tools instead. We first drafted our paper prototype with Powerpoint through teams and then implemented it in Figma(a prototype design tool). Below is a short video about the prototype we created.

### Moodboard
After we had a prototype in hand, we immediately asked our friends and families to try it out. According to the user feedback (refer to user questionnaires in the Understanding Users section), we made the following moodboard!

### Wireframes and Interaction Flow Diagrams
This section introduces the wireframes of our prototpe and the interaction flow diagrams of our products.

## Users and Stakeholders
We always prioritized users throughout our UX design process. There are two rounds of user research we made in total. 
### Identification of Users and Stakeholders
The first round happened during our ideation stage, where we shared our project ideas with our friends and families, and concluded that our potential users would be people with needs for progress tracking and habit forming and confirmed that relevant product managers and developers would be stakeholders. According to that conclusion and discussion during ideation stage, we managed to draw user persona sketch at the very begining of our UI design process. Please scroll up to the user persona sketch section to see more details!
### Understanding Users
Right after we created our prototype, we asked our friends and families again to try out the application. This time, we made the following questionnaires to collect user feedbacks. 
<p align = "center">

<img src="/Report%20Materials/user%20feedback/Q2.png" alt="Q2" width="600"/>
<img src="/Report%20Materials/user%20feedback/Q3.png" alt="Q3" width="600"/>
<img src="/Report%20Materials/user%20feedback/Q4.png" alt="Q4" width="600"/>
<img src="/Report%20Materials/user%20feedback/Q5.png" alt="Q5" width="600"/>
<img src="/Report%20Materials/user%20feedback/Q6.png" alt="Q6" width="600"/>
<img src="/Report%20Materials/user%20feedback/Q7.png" alt="Q7" width="600"/>
<img src="/Report%20Materials/user%20feedback/Q8.png" alt="Q8" width="600"/>
</p>

Through this second round of user research, we confirmed three things:

  * **Target Users:** our initial assumption towards target users are accurate. Nearly 90% participants have experience of failing to sticking to plans and are in     need of progress-tracking/ habit-forming tools. All participants expressed willingness to use Little Planet after we release the complete product.
  * **Nice Features & User Pain Points:** existing progress-tracking/habit-forming applications are generally good at progress visualization but problems like hard     to use, lack of gamification or support for cross-platform accessibility are main pain points users have while using the products. In order to design a         product that users enjoy to use, we shoud avoid user pain points and value features users valued, like progress visualization.
  * **Suggestions & Takeaways:** as it can be seen from the evluation summary, there is still space for Little Planets to make improvements. Two participants gave us scores of 4 on user experience of Little Planet(Q4), and that was because the prototype UI looked too simple and they were hoping to see more fun elements on the interface. Considering all the problems users pointed out, our next steps will be: 
    * adding more colorful and fun elements to UI, but keeping the interface free from advertisements.
    * increasing user enjoyment through adding more fun elements, like upgrading CCG to TCG and add more collections of cards with different themes.
