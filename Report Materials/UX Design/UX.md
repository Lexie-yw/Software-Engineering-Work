## Ideation
The team started the project with brainstorming ideas for a novel web application that can solve a real world problem while making users enjoy using it. To create such a product, we first started our discussion through teams on what problems we might solve and what game mechanisms we can adopt to solve the problems. Below is a Jamboard (Figure 1) we created during designing thinking:

As you can see, items on the left side are potential problems that exist in our life and the right side shows game mechanisms we came up with. We concluded that habit forming is what we are interested in, because nearly everyone has the experience of writing down new yearâ€™s goals at the beginning of a year but failed to achieve them when it came to the end of the year. There are tons of habit-tracking applications or progress tracker applications aiming at solving this problem in the digital market, but the problem with these apps is that they lack elements to keep users engaged in using them, such as games and rewards.

To implement a fun to use habit-forming application, we decided to add a card collecting game (CCG) mechanism to the application to keep users engaged and motivated. Users who manage to track their goals and eventually achieve the goals will be rewarded with cards. The more goals they achieve, the more cards they will obtain and more likely to get all cards of a particular theme. The first theme of cards we implement is city views, which caters to our tagline: form your habits to build your little planet.
