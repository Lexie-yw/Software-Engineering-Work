## Design Process
## Ideation
The team started the project with brainstorming ideas for a novel web application that can solve a real world problem while making users enjoy using it. To create such a product, we first started our discussion through teams on what problems we might solve and what game mechanisms we can adopt to solve the problems. Below is a Jamboard (Figure 1) we created during designing thinking:

As you can see, items on the left side are potential problems that exist in our life and the right side shows game mechanisms we came up with. We concluded that habit forming is what we are interested in, because nearly everyone has the experience of writing down new yearâ€™s goals at the beginning of a year but failed to achieve them when it came to the end of the year. There are tons of habit-tracking applications or progress tracker applications aiming at solving this problem in the digital market, but the problem with these apps is that they lack elements to keep users engaged in using them, such as games and rewards.

To implement a fun to use habit-forming application, we decided to add a Card Collecting Game (CCG) mechanism to the application to keep users engaged and motivated. Users who manage to track their goals and eventually achieve the goals will be rewarded with cards. The more goals they achieve, the more cards they will obtain and more likely to get all cards of a particular theme. The first theme of cards we implemented is city views, which caters to our tagline: form your habits to build your little planet. A possible extension of the app would be turning the CCG game mechanism to a Trading and Collecting Game (TCG) game mechanism, allowing users to exchange cards they obtained.

## Early Prototyping
We named our habit-forming application Little Planet and set a tagline for it: form your habits to build your little planet.  
### User Persona Sketch
Based on the conclusion from the ideation stage, we identified that our potential users would be people who are interested in progress tracking and habit forming, and the broader stakeholders would be relevant developers and product managers of the product. Below is a user persona sketch (Figure 2) we made to guide our initial prototyping:

</p>
No matter what age they are; where they are from; what occupation they have, as long as they are interested in personal development and want to achieve goals or form habits, they can use Little Planet to motivate themselves to make progress.


### Initial Prototyping
With the user persona sketch as a guidance, we decided that Little Planet should implement the following features:
  * Progress Tracking / Progress Visualization
  * CCG
  * Simple in Style
  * Streamlined Workflow

We then drafted our initial wireframe with powerpoint and implemented it in Figma, below is a short video about the low fidelity prototype we created with Figma.
