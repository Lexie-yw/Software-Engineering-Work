# Background and Motivation 

In this part, we first found the right game reward according to the original product design. We checked a lot of references and targeted the reward on the cards like TCG. Then we found in the literature that there are already reports of applying TCG cards as a reward element in the education field, which can well motivate students to accomplish their goals. This model of combining learning and entertainment inspired us to design the product, and we decided to add the punch card element to the product and expand the target users from students to any people who are interested in clocking in to accomplish their goals. Each time a user completes a goal, he or she is rewarded with a card, and in future expansions of the product, users can exchange their cards with other users. Also, in order to expand the user base, cards with different themes can be designed in future expansions.

## Academic research review 
The application of cards as rewards to clock in products has gained a lot of popularity among educators.

As a research done in the school, reward is the simplest way to motivate students in education. It can encourage students to learn and get immediate achievement. However, traditional rewards are often less valuable thus can’t keep motivating students, e.g. symbolic rewards like stars or stickers can’t be used by the students after the class; therefore, the values of symbolic rewards are not appreciated by the students. Through the TCG, the rewards can hold students’ interest for longer.

In order to verify the effectiveness of the use of in-game cards as rewards, the research team integrated the trading card game into a web-based English vocabulary learning system. Students can receive cards as rewards every time after they use the learning system. A 6-week experiment had been conducted at an elementary school with 172 fifth-grade students. The results showed that boys have higher intention of getting the in-game cards as rewards. The research also showed that the use of the in-game cards as educational rewards not only motivates students to use the vocabulary learning system but also improves their learning outcome.

Then we were curious about what aspects of CCGs/TCGs make them so popular that people will spend years playing them and buying expansions. A quick look at this question reveals two interlocked features in all CCGs/TCGs. First, they’re collectible. Most CCGs involve random collection through a “booster pack”system while some games you simply buy non–random packs to obtain cards. The second feature is customization. Once players have collected enough cards, they choose which of those cards they will use in their decks. This lends a sense of ownership to the game, as players have the opportunity to demonstrate their skills, as players and as creators. Even between relatively similar deck designs, individual tastes and choices can be seen.

After discovering that the card element could be integrated with the learning reward mechanism, we started our own product design.



## Current industry review
### little clock in

The goal of the product “little clock in” is to "help users develop habits and accomplish their goals", and the main product carrier is a small program, which is used as an entrance to a social forum rather than an independent app. 

It will record users' punching times after they set their goals, and users can also record videos to attract others to pay attention to their punching items, so that groups with similar hobbies can be attracted together to form many dynamic communities, and relevant product ads can be pushed in different communities. This will lead users to other products, thus completing its function as an entrance.


### Magic The Gathering

</p>


A player in Magic takes the role of a Planeswalker, doing battle with other players as Planeswalkers by casting spells, using artifacts, and summoning creatures as depicted on individual cards drawn from their individual decks. A player defeats their opponent typically (but not always) by casting spells and attacking with creatures to deal damage to the opponent's "life total," with the object being to reduce it from 20 to 0. Although the original concept of the game drew heavily from the motifs of traditional fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, the gameplay bears little similarity to pencil-and-paper adventure games, while simultaneously having substantially more cards and more complex rules than many other card games. New cards are released on a regular basis through expansion sets. An organized tournament system (the DCI) played at the international level and a worldwide community of professional Magic players has developed, as well as a substantial resale market for Magic cards. Certain cards can be valuable due to their rarity in production and utility in gameplay, with prices ranging from a few cents to tens of thousands of dollars.

As the evergreen of TCG games, " Magic The Gathering " has been successfully operated for many years, but its target users are very single and increasingly difficult to expand, most of them are card lovers or anime fans.


## Problem definition
Littleplanet has two elements: progress tracker and TCG(although now it’s CCG). The existing similar products all have some defects. Simple progress tracker products are not strong enough for intercourse between users, but only as the entrance of the platform to inbound marketing, or as an accessory of platform promotion and operation, but not as a separate product to achieve the intercourse of users within the product. The stickiness of these products is relatively low, and they have no other value after completing the function of redirection. As for TCG product, the target users are relatively single, mainly card game players of a certain theme, and the product is only spread in a small circle.

## Our improvements 
### How we make improvements

Compared to those apps that aim to attract traffic, Littleplanet's reward mechanism of clocking in after completing tasks can make users enthusiastic enough to invest in accomplishing their targets, because the product itself can bring users a good reward experience and improve the stickiness of the product itself. At the same time, its TCG elements with social attributes can allow those players who are eager to collect the whole set of cards to improve the collection efficiency by trading their excess duplicate cards with other players, and users will be motivated to spontaneously promote and spread the app because they want to have close people to collect and exchange cards with. Compared to pure TCG games, Littleplanet's target audience is more diverse than just card game players. Users are motivated to use the app because they want an app to urge them to clock in and accomplish their goals, and the rewards for accomplishing their goals will make them fall in love with the app.

### Expansion in the future

The app's reward theme can be set to your choice, and the prototype defaults to cities on the Earth, and getting that city card can light up that city on the app's built-in globe display page, while collecting cards from one continent can light up that continent and eventually the entire planet. After lighting up the Earth you can unlock other planets or galaxies in the universe. This phased incentive will allow the user to have a quick positive feedback after reaching the task. At the same time, you can share your collection progress or unlocking level to social products to improve its social properties. We can provide different reward themes for the app, which can bring stronger expandability. For example, setting the reward element as animals can attract more animal lovers to use the product. After getting the corresponding cards, there will be a special card introduction, such as the history of the city or the habits of the animals, so that users can take the opportunity to expand their knowledge, which could combine entertainment and education in one app.
