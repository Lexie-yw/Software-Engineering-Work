## Academic research review 
The application of cards as rewards to clock in products has gained a lot of popularity among educators.

Reward is the simplest way to motivate students in education. It can encourage students to learn and get immediate achievement. However, traditional rewards are often less valuable thus can’t keep motivating students, e.g. symbolic rewards like stars or stickers can’t be used by the students after the class; therefore, the values of symbolic rewards are not appreciated by the students. Through the TCG, the rewards can hold students’ interest for longer.

In order to verify the effectiveness of the use of in-game cards as rewards, the research team integrated the trading card game into a web-based English vocabulary learning system. Students can receive cards as rewards every time after they use the learning system. A 6-week experiment had been conducted at an elementary school with 172 fifth-grade students. The results showed that boys have higher intention of getting the in-game cards as rewards. The research also showed that the use of the in-game cards as educational rewards not only motivates students to use the vocabulary learning system but also improves their learning outcome.

## Current industry review
The goal of the product “little clock in” is to "help users develop habits and accomplish their goals", and the main product carrier is a small program, which is used as an entrance to a social forum rather than an independent app.

As the evergreen of TCG games, " Magic The Gathering " has been successfully operated for many years, but its target users are very single and increasingly difficult to expand, most of them are card lovers or anime fans.




## Problem
Littleplanet has two elements: daily attendance and TCG. The existing similar products all have some defects. Simple clock in products are not strong enough for intercourse between users, but only as the entrance of the platform to inbound marketing, or as an accessory of platform promotion and operation, but not as a separate product to achieve the intercourse of users within the product. The stickiness of these products is relatively low, and they have no other value after completing the function of redirection. As for TCG product, the target users are relatively single, mainly card game players of a certain theme, and the product is only spread in a small circle.

### Our strength 
Compared to those apps that aim to attract traffic, Littleplanet's reward mechanism of clocking in after completing tasks can make users enthusiastic enough to invest in accomplishing their targets, because the product itself can bring users a good reward experience and improve the stickiness of the product itself. At the same time, its TCG elements with social attributes can allow those players who are eager to collect the whole set of cards to improve the collection efficiency by trading their excess duplicate cards with other players, and users will be motivated to spontaneously promote and spread the app because they want to have close people to collect and exchange cards with. Compared to pure TCG games, Littleplanet's target audience is more diverse than just card game players. Users are motivated to use the app because they want an app to urge them to clock in and accomplish their goals, and the rewards for accomplishing their goals will make them fall in love with the app.
The app's reward theme can be set to your choice, and the prototype defaults to cities on the Earth, and getting that city card can light up that city on the app's built-in globe display page, while collecting cards from one continent can light up that continent and eventually the entire planet. After lighting up the Earth you can unlock other planets or galaxies in the universe. This phased incentive will allow the user to have a quick positive feedback after reaching the task. At the same time, you can share your collection progress or unlocking level to social products to improve its social properties. We can provide different reward themes for the app, which can bring stronger expandability. For example, setting the reward element as animals can attract more animal lovers to use the product. After getting the corresponding cards, there will be a special card introduction, such as the history of the city or the habits of the animals, so that users can take the opportunity to expand their knowledge, which could combine entertainment and education in one app.
