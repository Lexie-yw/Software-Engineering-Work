#Stack architecture  
In this project, we used the front and back end separation method. The front end uses Angular to render and display the page. The more popular Spring Boot is used to implement back end services in the background. The front end obtains and uploads data through Ajax request, and the back end returns the result to show the corresponding rendering effect.  
For data storage, we chose the relatively popular MongoDB, which has good support for files and json type data.  

**Middle Tier**  
###Springboot  
Spring Boot is a new framework from the Pivotal team designed to simplify the initial setup and development process for new Spring applications.  
The framework uses a specific way to configure, eliminating the need for developers to define boilerplate configurations. As a popular Java framework, SpringBoot can be easily integrated with MongoDB. We can manipulate MongoDB with code by simply adding code and MongoDB related configuration in its configuration file Application.yml.

At the same time, SpringBoot, as a server-side framework, integrates Tomcat container in spring-boot-starter-web. We just need to run it to provide services.

The background adopts the hierarchical management method. Under the com.work package, AppStart serves as the startup entry, and we place it in the root directory. Then we put the object entity under the Entity package, with User information and Goal information, respectively. With the user ID, we can get all the targets under that user. The user Id and target Id will be stored in the database as unique indexes. They are strings automatically generated by MongoDB.

The dao package implements database operations. They all inherit from MongoRepository, a parent class that provides support for various database operations. We can manipulate the database as if it were an object call.   
The Server layer holds the service interface, and the specific implementation of the service is in the server.impl. We also created the underlying return information under the resp package.   
The Response class is returned as a uniformly formatted data format, with code identifying the return code. msg is the message prompt and data is the data returned. Finally, the Controller provides the interface path and the mapping implementation. It is in a resful style, and the return type is json, which is convenient for passing down and receiving.

For the interface document, we use the interface document generated by postman. postman is an interface testing tool that provides a lot of support for interface testing. All we need to do is log in and import the documentation we provide, so we can view the relevant interface request parameters and returns under the collection, as well as perform relevant tests locally.
