## Abstract   
### Why(Our motivation)?
&emsp;&emsp;You may find it quiet difficult to form a habit, our teammates also have the same concern. First it actually take a lot of time to form a habit, according to research, forming a habit may take you about 66 days in average(see **Figure 1**)<sup>1</sup>; Second, our society is full of [fragment information](http://github.com), it also block people from focuse on something that is difficult to get **short-term feedback**, just like habit forming; At last, even if you have enough time and with any External interference, you may also failed because don't know the right way to form a habit.

&emsp;&emsp;Good habits not only allow you to focus on your career and keep you full of energy. Similarly, A growing literature demonstrates the relevance of habit-formation principles to health<sup>2.3</sup>. herein, we find the entry point of our app.

### What(Problem we aim to solve)?
&emsp;&emsp;There is three basic problem we aim to solve by develop this app.

* Help users form habits start from the very beginning(Primary goal).
* Help users become self-disciplined.
* Raise awareness that habits can be formed scientifically and effectively by spread the knowledge of habit forming.

### Higher level overview of our project.
&emsp;&emsp;Little planet is a one page web application that helps users to form habits in the form of CCG(Card Collect Game), We let users to seperate their big goal into small and easy pieces, everytime users achieved a small goal they can click in and get a corresponding card reward(representative attractions in various countries), this will motivate users carry on their habit forming process. we also store the user's  habit forming path in local database, so users can review their achievement in the web page library. Our app follow the classic repetition-feedback model in psychology, so users can get timely feedback after completing the staged small goals, users can finally form some habits by the repetition of this process.

## Project Objectives.
&emsp;&emsp;Our primary goal is to complete a MEAN stack single page application, which front-end allow users to setup goals, click-in and review their achievement and save all these data in database by the implementation of java. 

### Higher level goals.
* Spread the knowledge of scientific habit forming, especially in university student group, so user group may know how to design a plan to form a habit themselves.
* By achieve goals through divide big goals into small part, we raise awareness of the power **fragmentation**, at the same time, we hope user could know how attractive and easy addictive fragment-information is, so user can stay away from these temptations in their future lives.

### System design logic/how we solve our problem.
&emsp;&emsp;We implement some key concept into our app design:
* Not linear.
   Habit-forming is not linear, which means that the process of habit shaping requires incremental rewards or feedback.
* Repetation-feedback model.
   Repetition-feedback model follows a process of repeating specific behaviors or prohibiting specific behaviors as planned, and obtaining timely feedback.
* Times is all we need.
   According to Phillippa Lally's famouse theory, It may take 66 days in average to form a habit, and the number of our rewards corresponds to it .

  Little planet is a single page web application that helps people forming habit, and we inplement all these habit forming pattern into our app design. We allow users to setup specific goals and set times needed to achieve this goal, everytime user complete small goal, they need to click-in on our app and will receive a random card as stage reward, after user complete a certain goal(click-in enough time), little planet back-end will save this goal in libray to let user review in future. and user can review all rewards they get in gallary page.
  
## Team Checklist
&emsp;&emsp;Following are some key point to check the outcome of our team:
* Build a working single page application that has all features we mentioned above.
* Design more attractive UI and improve the quality of our programm to attract more users.
* Raise awareness of scientific habit forming among our user group, help users to become self-decipline.
