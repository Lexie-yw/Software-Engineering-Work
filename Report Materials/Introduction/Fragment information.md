Here we simple explain what is fragment information and the hazards of **fragmented information**.

First we need to categorize different type of information
* Invalid redundant information
* Repetitive information that reinforces existing knowledge
* Previously unknown valid information
* Improve existing knowledge
* Information that produces new cognition after destroying inherent cognition 

&emsp;&emsp;The later information is more useful, but you will find that most of the fragmented information tends to be concentrated in the top 3. and their hazards is listed as follow:

* The content is often facts rather than logic, so you don't need to think much.
* The organization logic is not systematic and in-depth.
* Easy to distract.
* Prone to the illusion of continuous learning and improvement.
* The effect of group communication leads to a decline in independent thinking ability.

&emsp;&emsp;So we need to get rid of these fragment information, but at the same time, can we use the features of fragment information to help us develop some skills? Like the features that its small and easy to adopt.
