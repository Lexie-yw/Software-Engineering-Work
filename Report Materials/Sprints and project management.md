The fountain model was used in our group work. Fountain Model is a kind of model driven by user demand and object, which is mainly used to describe the object-oriented software development process. The model considers that the stages of the bottom-up cycle of software development process are mutually iterative and have no gap.   

Fountain models are mainly used in software development projects using object technology. The model considers that the stages of the bottom-up cycle of software development process are mutually iterative and have no gap. A piece of software is often reworked many times, with related objects adding incremental software components to each iteration. No gap means that there is no obvious boundary between various activities, such as analysis and design activities. Due to the introduction of the object concept, the expression of analysis, design, implementation and other activities only uses object classes and relations, so it is easier to realize the iteration and no gap of activities, so that its development naturally includes reuse.

* Advantages of the fountain model:  

Unlike waterfall models, fountain models need to start designing activities after the analysis activities and coding activities after the design activities. The phases of the model are not clearly demarcated and developers can develop simultaneously. Its advantage is that it can improve the software project development efficiency, save the development time, and adapt to the object-oriented software development process.
