## Reflect on the working practices   


&nbsp;

In the early stages of the project, we often used Teams and WeChat to communicate. After brainstorming, we selected several topics that we were interested in, and wrote the general outline of the project. Finally, we voted to determine the final project. At first, we felt very confused about how to design our project and achieve the functionality we expected. Therefore, we kept in frequent communication and consulted the teaching assistant. We first divided the work simply and went to Youtube and various learning resource websites to learn. We study separately and then get together to discuss problems after we know a bit about our respective fields.

In the process of doing this project, we met a lot of difficulties, because we learned very simple content, which brought a lot of pressure to our project development. As our team leader, Yiwen provided us with many ideas and helped us a lot in every stage of the project development. And in the sprint from Easter, our organized work schedule has taken a lot of pressure off of us.

Due to the time zone differences, there are many times when we can't have meetings together, so the WeChat group and Git are very convenient for us. In order to keep everyone's progress consistent, we will communicate our progress and work arrangement every week. At first we had some difficulties with the database, but we worked together to get the database connected to the back end. We also encountered difficulties in the front and back end interface problems, and later we exchanged working ideas and solved the problem. Thanks to every member of the team for their contribution to the project!

## Reflective discussion of the success of the project  


&nbsp;


In the age of the Internet, we are bombarded with fragmented information every day. We try our best to catch up for fear of missing a piece of information, as if we will be abandoned by The Times. However, these fragmented information is destroying our ability to think deeply step by step. Self-discipline has become a very difficult thing for us, we spend a lot of time on useless news and short videos. Therefore, time planning becomes an urgent problem for us to solve.  

&nbsp;

The successful implementation of this project mainly depends on the following conditions:

(1) Actively cooperate with team members, reasonably plan personal time for the development and implementation of the project, make reasonable sacrifices for the team, and cooperate with teammates to complete tasks.

(2) The division of labor should be reasonable. According to the skills and hobbies of the team members, the division of labor should be carried out. Each member should perform his or her own duties, and the members should communicate and cooperate with each other.

(3) The team master advanced technology applicable to the project, which is the guarantee of whether the performance of the system is optimized and whether the project is successful.

&nbsp;

The constraints for the development of this project are as follows:

(1) Short development cycle: the time from the determination of the project to the submission of the finished product is only two months, which is relatively short and requires the developer to make reasonable planning of the time.

(2) Limited methods and technologies adopted: the technical level of the project team members is not mature enough, and the programming foundation is relatively weak, so it is necessary to learn various technologies and abilities concurrently in the development.

&nbsp;

We designed this project to help people achieve the goal of habit building, and to increase the curiosity of our Little Planet app by making the features more interesting with the set of card rewards. And we hope that this will increase the user's motivation to achieve their goals. Through our teamwork, we achieved the functionality we expected, and despite some minor bugs and room for modification, we are happy with our results.

## How coronavirus has affected our project  

&nbsp;


Due to the influence of COVID-19, our team members are in different countries and there is time difference, which has a great impact on our communication and cooperation. We can't exchange ideas face to face, study and discuss knowledge together. We have no access to the school library for reference. Fortunately, our teaching fellows were conscientious and gave us a lot of useful advice, which was of great significance to the success of our project.

We use online media properly to communicate and minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our work. Due to COVID-19, we were unable to recommend our app to as many users as possible to get more user feedback. At the same time, we think that during the epidemic, people have less recreational activities, which may make us more addicted to our phones and unable to achieve our goals. So we think that our design of Little Planet can help people to plan their time properly and avoid wasting time during an epidemic. We had a tough time together, and we got it done.

## Discussion of Social and Ethical implications

&nbsp;

The information age has brought unspeakable convenience and benefits, but the network is a virtual world, which has brought us some negative effects. On the network platform, some teenagers are addicted to online video games, which produce more and more strong psychological dependence and temptation to operate repeatedly. When they can't play games, they will appear emotional irritability, depression and other symptoms. It causes damage to eyesight and nerves, reduces the flexibility of the brain and affects academic performance.

Network is the product of human technological progress. While improving the quality of people's participation in all kinds of activities, it may cause damage to some network users. People must correctly understand the two sides of the network, avoid its shortcomings, use its advantages, give play to the convenience of the network to people.

Little Planet is designed to help people figure out their near-term goals and plan their time. By setting goals to drive users to improve their concentration and action, they reduce the amount of time spent playing. In terms of user data privacy, we capture only the necessary functional data and store it securely.

We worry about whether our habit-forming ideas will create stress for users. Users may become anxious if they are unable to achieve the goals they set. So far, we haven't seen any of this, but we'll be looking at it in the future.


&nbsp;


## Discussion of future work

&nbsp;


In the future, we look forward to building a community of users to provide a space for users to communicate with each other. Users can exchange their short-term and long-term tasks, and people with the same plans can learn and progress together. We wanted to build a leaderboard of user goals and engagement duration. And we will improve our application features and enrich our reward system to give users a better experience.
