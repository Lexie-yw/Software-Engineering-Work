## Reflect on the working practices   

In the early stages of the project, we often used Teams and WeChat to communicate. After brainstorming, we selected several topics that we were interested in, and wrote the general outline of the project. Finally, we voted to determine the final project. At first, we felt very confused about how to design our project and achieve the functionality we expected. Therefore, we kept in frequent communication and consulted the teaching assistant. We first divided the work simply and went to Youtube and various learning resource websites to learn. You study separately and then you get together and you know a little bit about your field.

In the process of doing this project, we met a lot of difficulties, because we learned very simple content, which brought a lot of pressure to our project development. As our team leader, Yiwen provided us with many ideas and helped us a lot in every stage of the project development. And in the sprint from Easter, our organized work schedule has taken a lot of pressure off of us.

Due to the time zone differences, there are many times when we can't have meetings together, so the WeChat group and Git are very convenient for us. In order to keep everyone's progress consistent, we will communicate our progress and work arrangement every week. At first we had some difficulties with the database, but we worked together to get the database connected to the back end. We also encountered difficulties in the front and back end interface problems, and later we exchanged working ideas and solved the problem. Thanks to every member of the team for their contribution to the project!
